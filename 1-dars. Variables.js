// Variables are containers for storing data values.

// Always declare javascript variables with "var", "let", or "const".
// The "var" keyword is used in all javascript code from 1995 to 2015.
// The "let" and "const" keywords were added to javascript in 2015.
// If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use "var".

// The two variables "price1" and "price2" are declared with the "const" keyword.
// These are constant values and cannot be changed. 

// The variable "total" is declared with the "let" keyword.
// This is a value that can be changed.

// All javascript variables must be identified with unique names.
// These unique names are called identifiers.
// In the above example, "5" and "6" are identifiers.

// Javascript identifiers are case-sensitive.
// "y" and "Y" are different variables.

let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;
let y = _x + _100;
console.log(y);

// Since javascript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing "_" are  valid variable names. 

// HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define the content of web pages.
// Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to describe the layout of web pages.
// Javascript is the programming language which is used to program the behaviour of web pages.
